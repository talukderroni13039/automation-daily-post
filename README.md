ðŸš€ Project Summary â€“ Automation Daily Post

The Automation Daily Post system is a fully automated .NET background application designed to streamline daily reporting tasks. It securely retrieves task data (task name, hours worked, and notes) from an API, formats it, and automatically posts the update to a target web application using Selenium WebDriverâ€”without any manual effort.

The application runs on a daily schedule via Windows Task Scheduler, logs into the system with encrypted credentials, submits the latest data, captures a screenshot confirmation, and sends an email notification with the result. It features robust error handling, automatic retries, and structured logging for reliability.

Built with a clean, modular architecture, the solution emphasizes security, performance, and scalability. It also supports quick configuration updates and smooth integration with CI/CD pipelines, making it a practical DevOps-friendly automation tool for teams that need consistent, hands-free daily reporting.
